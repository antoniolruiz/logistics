# Document Intelligence - Modular Structure

This directory contains the Document Intelligence application, now split into smaller, more manageable files for better maintainability and organization.

## File Structure

### Main Files
- **`index.html`** - Clean HTML structure with references to external files
- **`styles.css`** - All CSS styling separated into its own file
- **`script.js`** - All JavaScript functionality separated into its own file

### Legacy
- **`document-intelligence.html`** - Original monolithic file (194KB, 3,784 lines)

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Better Organization**: Separate concerns (HTML structure, styling, functionality)
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Each file type can be edited independently
3. **Improved Performance**: CSS and JS files can be cached separately
4. **Development Efficiency**: Syntax highlighting and IDE features work better with separate files
5. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different aspects simultaneously

## File Size Comparison

| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **Original** | 194KB | Monolithic file with everything |
| **New Structure** | **185KB total** | Modular approach |
| ↳ index.html | 47KB | HTML structure |
| ↳ styles.css | 13KB | All styling |
| ↳ script.js | 125KB | All functionality |

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser - it will automatically load the CSS and JavaScript files to provide the same functionality as the original file.

The application maintains 100% of its original functionality while being easier to manage and develop.
